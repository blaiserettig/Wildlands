# Wildlands

Wildlands is a 2D top-down action strategy game about aerial firefighting in northern Canada.

It was developed over three months as part of a capstone project for my Game Development Programming Minor at Chapman University. It takes much inspiration from the gameplay and art style of Highfleet, as well as games like Papers, Please, and Supreme Commander.

You can play the game by cloning the repository and running the executable. It is intended for 1920x1080 displays only, so you may encounter issues on screens of different resolutions or aspect ratios.

As of now, the development of Wildlands is finished, although I do hope to one day revisit and refactor it into something more complete with the lessons and information I have learned along the way.
